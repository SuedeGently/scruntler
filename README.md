# Scruntler #

Scruntler is a word game in which the player attempts to guess a well-known
phrase by looking at a version of the sentence in which the majority of words
have been replaced with synonyms.

## Usage ##

Just don't use this yet. If you really want to,  clone this repo and use `cargo
run` to build and run.

## Dependencies ##

This makes use of The CollegiateÂ® Thesaurus API, which requires an API key.
Mine is present in this repo, left there in good faith, however it should be
replaced with the user's own when running this. Additionally, should the API
fail or go down, so will this codebase.
